\title{Download krpoltext datasets from OSF}
\usage{
download_data(dataset = "all", force = FALSE, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Character vector of datasets to download. Valid values are
\code{"campaign_booklet"}, \code{"party_statements"}, or \code{"all"} (default).}

\item{force}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, re-download even if cached files exist.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{quiet}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, suppress progress messages. Defaults to
\code{FALSE}.}
}

}
\description{
Downloads the CSV data files from the OSF repository and caches them locally
as RDS files for fast subsequent loading. On first use the function asks for
interactive consent before starting the download.
}
\details{
Downloaded CSV files are read with \code{\link[data.table:fread]{data.table::fread()}}, then saved as
compressed RDS in the user's cache directory
(\code{tools::R_user_dir("krpoltext", "cache")}). The original CSV is not kept
on disk; only the RDS cache is stored.

File integrity is verified via SHA-256 checksums published with the OSF
release.
